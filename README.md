Easy-Publication.

It's an easy and hassle-free self-publishing platform where anyone can publish anything under the terms & conditions. If the published book is sold then we will share the revenue with our registered publishers.

In our country, authors are hassled by publishers for publishing a book. Most of the time Publishers want a big amount of money to publish the book. why? Cause existing publishers don't know how many copies will be sold! Which means they are scared about profit. They calculated the Estimated profit. So most of the time manual publishers are not interested in new authors. That's why a new author is fighting their luck to publish their very first book.

We believe our project can solve this problem. Our System builds with so much flexibility like we ensure the ordered product will be delivered in under 24 hours. That will be possible because we ensure 64 printing presses in 64 districts.
